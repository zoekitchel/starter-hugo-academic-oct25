As a Visiting Assistant Professor at Occidental College, I am committed to inclusive and rewarding learning experiences for my students. I have found that students learn best when expectations are clear, when the way the material is conveyed is varied, and when the knowledge and skills taught in the classroom will clearly support students in future personal and professional pursuits.

I understand the classroom is not always a safe and comfortable space for all students. To foster inclusivity, I share my background and positionality, establish community guidelines, and make it clear that the classroom is a place for asking hard questions and exploring personal biases, but not for prejudices and judgement.

At Rutgers University, I designed and taught courses and workshops for graduate students and faculty on a range of topics related to effective teaching strategies, and more general techniques for supporting students in and outside of the classroom. I also mentored multiple students from underrepresented groups in STEM through the [Rutgers Rise Program](https://www.rise.rutgers.edu/) during independent research projects. 

As a project associate with the [Teaching Assistant Project](https://grad.rutgers.edu/professional-development/teaching-skills/ta-project) at Rutgers University and a member of [Rutgers Academy for the Scholarship of Teaching and and Learning](https://grad.rutgers.edu/professional-development/rastl), I developed and facilitated orientations for new teaching assistants, taught semester graduate courses on higher education and course design, and ran interactive workshops to help faculty and graduate students expand their teaching toolkit and evaluate their teaching techniques.

I am available for guest lectures and workshops on marine biology, climate change, and inclusivity in higher education. Don't hesitate to get in touch.
