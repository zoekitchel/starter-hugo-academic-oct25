I am committed to inclusive and rewarding learning experiences for my students. At Rutgers, I have designed and taught courses in addition to leading workshops for graduate students and faculty on a range of topics associated with relevant and effective teaching strategies, and more general techniques for supporting students in and outside of the classroom. I have also mentored multiple students from underrepresented groups in STEM through the [Rutgers Rise Program](https://www.rise.rutgers.edu/) during independent research projects. 

As a project associate with the [Teaching Assistant Project](https://grad.rutgers.edu/professional-development/teaching-skills/ta-project) at Rutgers University and a member of [Rutgers Academy for the Scholarship of Teaching and and Learning](https://grad.rutgers.edu/professional-development/rastl), I develop and facilitate orientations for new teaching assistants, I teach semester graduate courses on higher education and course design, and I run interactive workshops to help faculty and graduate students expand their teaching toolkit and evaluate their teaching techniques.
